const EMR_01 = `An 87-year-old man was admitted to our hospital for anorexia for several days, high-grade fever from the previous day, and liver dysfunction. Of note, he had a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and angina. Physical examination findings included: clear consciousness; height, 163 cm; weight, 48 kg; blood pressure, 66/40 mmHg; heart rate, 75/min; respiratory rate, 22/min; oxygen saturation of peripheral artery, 96%; and body temperature, 38.1 °C. He had no surface lymphadenopathy. Laboratory findings included: white blood cell (WBC) count, 4.2 × 109/L; hemoglobin, 9.6 g/dL; platelet count, 106 × 109/L; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 1662 IU/L; aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 6562 IU/L; alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 1407 IU/L; alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 509 IU/L; γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP), 130 IU/L; total bilirubin, 2.7 mg/dL; prothrombin time (PT), 20.3 s; international normalized ratio (INR), 1.73; blood urea nitrogen (BUN), 34.4 mg/dL; and creatinine, 1.4 mg/dL. Serologic tests were all negative for hepatitis A, B, C, and E. Computed tomography (CT) performed at admission revealed no distinct nodules or masses in the liver, but mild splenomegaly, multiple hypodense splenic lesions, and para-aortic lymph node swelling (Fig. a–c). Antibiotics were administered intravenously for suspected acute cholangitis and sepsis, but the fever persisted. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed 2 days later newly depicted gallbladder wall thickening and ascites (Figs. , ). On the same night, the patient presented with grade II hepatic encephalopathy, with blood tests showing a decrease in platelet count and worsening liver function suggestive of “acute type” ALF with hepatic coma and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). While consideration was being given to treating acute liver failure, the patient suddenly developed ventricular fibrillation and died despite immediate resuscitation measures on day 3 of hospitalization. Given the rapid clinical course, an autopsy was performed in this patient with suspected ALF likely due to drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis of indeterminate etiology, circulatory disturbance, metabolic disease, or malignant cells including malignant lymphoma. This led to the patient being diagnosed with malignant, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, characterized by multiple lymph-node, as well as multi-organ (i.e., spleen, liver, lung, and prostate) involvement: (1) general swelling of lymph nodes in the para-abdominal aorta (Fig. a), peripancreatic, peribronchial, pulmonary hilar, subclavicular regions, as well as in the pelvis, especially around the iliac arteries, measuring up to 60 mm in diameter; (2) presence of multiple whitish splenic nodules (Fig. b) with the entire spleen shown to be microscopically infiltrated by tumor cells (Fig. a); (3) irregular geographical morphology of the liver (Fig. c) with the lymphoma cells mainly infiltrating the portal areas (Fig. b); (4) involvement of the right lobe of the lung; (5) involvement of both lobes of the prostate consequent to outer connective tissue involvement (Fig. c). Microscopically, the tumor cells in the lymph nodes were shown to have medium-sized irregular nuclei and small nucleoli with a high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, thus showing diffuse proliferation characterized by the presence of large numbers of small T-cells (Fig. ). Immunohistochemistry revealed the tumor cells to be positive for CD20 (Fig. a), CD79a (Fig. b), bcl-2 (Fig. c), and MUM1 (Fig. d), but negative for CD3 (Fig. e), CD10, bcl-6, and cyclin D1, with a Ki-67 labeling index (Ki-67 LI) of 16% (Fig. f). The causes of death were thus determined as (1) DIC and (2) ALF associated with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.`

const EMR_02 = `The  patient is a 52-year-old female who presents to the emergency  department with sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath that  began earlier today. She describes the chest pain as sharp and worse  when taking a deep breath. She also reports coughing up a small amount  of blood-streaked sputum. Upon further questioning, she mentions  noticeable swelling and discomfort in her left calf compared to the  right, which started yesterday.
Her  vital signs are as follows: Heart rate is 110 beats per minute, oxygen  saturation on room air is 93%, blood pressure is 128/82 mmHg,  respiratory rate is 24 breaths per minute, and temperature is 37.0°C.
Regarding  her relevant history: She reports that her last normal menstrual period  (LMP) started on 01/12/2006. She has a past medical history significant  for a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in her left leg three years ago. She  underwent an elective knee arthroscopy under general anesthesia 20 days  ago. She is currently taking oral estrogen-progestin hormone replacement  therapy for management of menopausal symptoms. She has no personal  history of cancer.
On  physical examination, there is marked swelling, erythema, and tenderness  of the left lower extremity from the mid-calf downward. The right leg  is normal.
After initial assessment, the treating physician states that pulmonary embolism is the leading diagnostic consideration.`

const EMR_03 = `A 68-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a 2-hour history of sudden onset right-sided chest pain and dyspnea, followed by 1 hour of confusion as reported by his family. The chest pain is sharp and pleuritic in nature. He also reports a recent cough with hemoptysis, noted as blood-tinged sputum this morning, and has experienced swelling and pain in his right calf for three days. His past medical history is significant for cirrhosis secondary to chronic Hepatitis B with a known history of recurrent ascites, a prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the left leg one year ago, and a recent right hip arthroplasty performed under general anesthesia 25 days ago following a femoral neck fracture. Post-operatively, he was largely immobilized for approximately three weeks. He has no history of malignancy. On examination, his vital signs show a temperature of 36.8°C, a heart rate of 118 bpm, a respiratory rate of 28/min, a blood pressure of 100/65 mmHg, and an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. He is confused and disoriented to time, consistent with grade 1-2 hepatic encephalopathy. Abdominal examination reveals distension with shifting dullness, indicating moderate ascites. Examination of his right lower extremity demonstrates significant calf swelling, warmth, and tenderness with a positive Homans' sign, confirming clinical signs of an acute DVT. Initial laboratory studies reveal a total bilirubin of 3.5 mg/dL, an albumin of 2.5 g/dL, and an INR of 1.9. The evaluating physician's primary working diagnosis is acute pulmonary embolism, with a concurrent acute-on-chronic exacerbation of his underlying liver disease.

const EMR_04 = `A 75-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a  one-day history of sudden-onset chest pain, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. The  chest pain is right-sided and worsens with deep inspiration. She  reports shortness of breath, palpitations, and coughing up a small  amount of bright red blood. She also complains of new swelling and pain  in her left lower leg. Her past medical history is significant for a  left lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosed one year ago,  treated with anticoagulation for three months. She underwent a right  total knee arthroplasty under general anesthesia three weeks ago for  osteoarthritis; she was bedridden for approximately one week  postoperatively and is now ambulating with a cane. She denies any  history of malignancy. On physical examination, her vital signs are:  temperature 36.8°C, heart rate 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate 24  per minute, and blood pressure 130/80 mmHg. She is alert.  Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. Her left leg is visibly  swollen compared to the right, with a 3 cm increase in calf  circumference, tenderness of the gastrocnemius muscle, and a positive  Homans' sign. Initial laboratory studies show a serum creatinine level  of 2.0 mg/dL. Her height is 160 cm, and her weight is 70 kg. The  evaluating emergency physician's primary working diagnosis is acute  pulmonary embolism, and a CT pulmonary angiogram is planned for further  evaluation.`
